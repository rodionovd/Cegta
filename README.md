Cegta
=====

A tiny DSL for TDD/BDD written in C.


### Why?
Cegta is just a PoC: one day I saw [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta) and wondered if I could use the same DSL for testing my projects written in plain C. As it turns, I can.

### What's BDD, BTW?
Check out the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development), discover [RSpec](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/internal_testing/rspec_and_bdd.html) or [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta) iteself.

### What it looks like?
Well, consider the snippet below:

```c
#include "Cegta.h"

CegtaRun();

SpecBegin(CegtaDemo)

	describe("Cegta's expect()", ^{
		it("should work well with integers and floating point numbers", ^{
			int demo_int = 42;
			expectInt(demo_int, toBe(42));
			// ...Like() for integers does exactly the same thing
			expectInt(demo_int, toBeLike(42));
			expectInt(demo_int, notToBe(90));
			expectInt(demo_int, notToBeLike(90));

			double demo_double = 38.121;
			expectDouble(demo_double, toBe(38.121));
			// ...Like() for floating point numbers is verifying
			// whether fabs(a-b) is less or equal to EPS
			expectDouble(demo_double, toBeLike(demo_double + CEGTA_EPSILON));
			expectDouble(demo_double, toBeLike(demo_double - CEGTA_EPSILON));
			expectDouble(demo_double, notToBeLike(demo_double + CEGTA_EPSILON*2));
			expectDouble(demo_double, notToBe(0.444444));
		});
	});

	describe("Cegta's expect()", ^{
		it("should work well with strings (char*) as well", ^{
			char* demo_str = "i am a demo string";
			// toBe() for strings is a strcmp()-based comparsion
			expectString(demo_str, toBe("i am a demo string"));
			// ...Like() for strings is a case insensitive comparison
			expectString(demo_str, toBeLike("i Am a DEmO strING"));
			expectString(demo_str, notToBeLike("another string"));
			// NULLs are also welcome
			expectString(demo_str, notToBe(NULL));
			expectString(NULL, toBe(NULL));
			expectString(NULL, notToBe(demo_str));
		});
	});

SpecEnd()
```
